/**
 * Widget Opener Utilities - Consistent widget opening across the application
 * 
 * Problem Solved:
 * Previously, when users clicked on widgets from different entry points (launcher, 
 * command palette, other components), they would always get a fresh widget starting 
 * in the default state. This created inconsistent user experiences where clicking 
 * on a "Project Details" link would open the main collaboration view instead of 
 * the specific project details.
 * 
 * Additional Problem: Multiple identical widgets were being created every time 
 * a user clicked on the same widget, leading to cluttered tabs and confusion.
 * 
 * Solution:
 * These utilities provide a consistent way to open widgets with specific initial 
 * states, ensuring that when a user clicks on "Project Details" or "Create Project", 
 * they get exactly what they expect. Additionally, widget deduplication prevents 
 * multiple identical widgets from being created - if a widget already exists, it 
 * will be activated instead of creating a new one.
 * 
 * Features:
 * - Initial state preservation (opens to specific views/projects)
 * - Widget deduplication (no duplicate tabs for the same content)
 * - Consistent experience across all entry points
 * - Graceful fallbacks if utilities aren't available
 * 
 * Usage Examples:
 * - openProjectDetails('0x123...abc') // Opens directly to project details
 * - openProjectCreation() // Opens directly to project creation form
 * - openMainCollaboration() // Opens main collaboration view
