This is a test file to confirm that I can create and edit files in your workspace. 

Now I'm adding a second line to test editing capabilities.

Here are some additional features I can test:
- Creating new files ✅
- Editing existing files ✅  
- Adding multiple lines ✅
- Using special characters: !@#$%^&*()
- Adding timestamps: Created on 2025-07-30

This confirms that my edit_file tool is working correctly!
